# library
Program in Java, that simulates library. User can freely add new items and delete them. It is also possible to borrow and return books. The program is written in Java and has two versions: JavaFX application and web application.

Exceptions and basic model class are stored in the main branch. These exceptions are required both in JavaFX and Web versions. JavaFX version does not include database, data are just stored in .txt file. However, Web version of the application uses Derby database, so data are stored in much more efficient way
